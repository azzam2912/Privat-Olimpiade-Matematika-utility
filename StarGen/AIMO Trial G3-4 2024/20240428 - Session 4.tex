    % \vspace{10cm} \item Among the 36 natural numbers from 1 to 36, at least how many numbers have to be picked so that there must be 2 numbers whose difference is 18?
    % \vspace{10cm} \item 6 different three-digit numbers can be formed using the digits "3", "6" and "8". Find the sum of these 6 three-digit numbers.
    
    \item Split the 4 numbers 6, 2, 0 and 9 into 2 groups and form 2 two-digit numbers respectively so that their product is maximized. Find the product.

    % \vspace{10cm} \item There are 55 cards. "1" is written on 1 card, "2" on 2 cards, "3" on 3 cards, \ldots, "10" on 10 cards. Now several cards are picked so that the sum of the numbers on all cards is 312. How many cards can be picked at most?
    
    \vspace{10cm} \item If $a \circ b = a + b + a \times b$, find the value of $5 \circ (8 \circ 3)$.
    % \vspace{10cm} \item If $a \diamond b = \begin{cases}

    % \end{cases}$, find the value of $(116 \diamond 16) \diamond (2 \diamond 8)$.
    % \vspace{10cm} \item Define the operation symbol $\oplus$ following this pattern:
    % \begin{align*}
    %     1 \oplus 5 &= 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 - 5\\
    %     3 \oplus 8 &= 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 - 8\\
    %     5 \oplus 9 &= 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 - 9\\
    %     \dots& \text{(and so on ...)}
    % \end{align*}
    % Find the value of $(5 \oplus 10) - (4 \oplus 9).$
