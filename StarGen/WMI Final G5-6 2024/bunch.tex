\section{2020 G6 B}
Certainly, I'll convert all the problems from this competition paper to LaTeX format. Here's the conversion:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Find the sum of all the 1-digit prime factors of 23464623.

    \item Bind 4 straws which are 2cm in diameter with a $a+b\pi$ cm long string. If both $a$ and $b$ are integers, find $a \times b$. (The knot does not take into consideration.)

    \item Given 4 different positive integers $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ that satisfy $\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{1}{c} + \frac{1}{d} = 1$. Find the minimum value of $a+b+c+d$.

    \item Given that the digits of a 4-digit number $A$ are even numbers, the digits of a 4-digit number $B$ are odd numbers, and the digits of a number $C$ are the alternation of odd and even numbers. If $C = A + B$, find the maximum value of $C$.

    \item In Jumping Grid, the player jumps 1 grid or 2 grids forward each time, such as jump from $\square$ to $\square$ or $\square$. If David is at $\square$, how many ways are there for him to jump to $\square$?

    \item If $\angle A = 35^\circ$, $\angle B = 40^\circ$, $\angle C = 30^\circ$, find the degrees of $\angle D + \angle E + \angle F$.

    \item Delete 6 of the 16 figures in the squares so that the numbers of the figures on each row and each column are even numbers. Find the maximum sum of the remaining 10 numbers.

    \item Take 9 numbers from 1--20 without repetition and fill them in a $3 \times 3$ grid so that the sums on each row, each column, and each diagonal are the same. If there are $a$ primes among these 9 numbers at most, and that the largest prime is $b$, find $a \times b$.

    \item The result of $123456789 \times 36 \times 5$ has $a$ 0's, $b$ 1's, and $c$ 2's. Find the 3-digit number $\overline{abc}$.

    \item The picture shows a Sudoku game with number 1 to 5. The number and the math symbol in the top left corner of the frame indicate the result in each frame. For example, "6+" means that the sum of the numbers in the frame is 6. Find the 5-digit number $\overline{ABCDE}$.
\end{enumerate}

% Note: For problems 5, 7, and 10, you may need to include the specific grid or Sudoku diagram as an image or create it using LaTeX drawing commands for a complete representation.

\section{2023 G5 A}

    \end{tabular}
    
    \item In a train carriage, $\frac{1}{4}$ of the passengers are young people, $\frac{2}{3}$ of the passengers are middle-aged people, and the rest are elderly people. Suppose there are 6 elderly people, and the number of seats in the carriage is $\frac{3}{4}$ of the number of passengers. How many passengers don't have a seat?
    
    \item The sum of three large, medium, and small numbers is 166. Given that the quotients of the large number divided by the medium number and the medium number divided by the small number are both 3, and their remainders are both 2, find the sum of all the digits of the large number.

    \item How many 6-digit numbers $x2023y$ are divisible by 286?
    
    \item Find the sum of all the digits of M.
    \[M = (1 - \frac{1}{2}) \times (2 - \frac{2}{3}) \times (3 - \frac{3}{4}) \times \cdots \times (8 - \frac{8}{9}) \times (9 - \frac{9}{10})\]
    
    \item Pour some water in a semicylinder container so that the angle between the rectangular face of the container and the water surface is $45^\circ$. Find the volume of the water in cm$^3$. ($\pi = 3.14$)
    
    \item Draw 3 different diagonals in a regular hexagon at will to make it a line symmetric figure. How many different line symmetric figures can be drawn at most? (If figures look the same after rotation, they are the same one)
