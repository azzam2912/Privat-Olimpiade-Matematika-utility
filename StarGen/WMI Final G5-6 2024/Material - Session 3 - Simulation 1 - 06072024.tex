\section*{Simulation Rules}

\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
    \item There will be \textbf{NO Zoom meetin}g for this simulation. Students are going to do it by themselves.
    
    \item Question papers are going to be uploaded to Google Drive, under folder ''Simulation'' at around 4-5 PM on the day of the simulation. Students may print or download the question paper.
    
    \item There are 25 questions in total.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Section A consists of 15 Multiple Choice Questions. Problems 1-10 score 6 points each. Problems 11-15 score 8 points each. No points are deducted for unanswered question or wrong answer.
        \item Section B consists of 10 Open-Ended Questions. They score 10 points each, no points are deducted for unanswered or wrong answer.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Total time: 90 minutes} 
    \newline
    Section A : 40 minutes.\\
    Break : 10 minutes \\
    Section B : 40 minutes.
    
    Students are advised to set a timer to ensure the timing is accurate and is according to the actual condition during WMI Finals 2024.
    
    \item In order to have the best simulation experience, students are advised to have necessary stationery, blank papers (to scribble), and bottled water.
    
    \item No calculators, smart watches/digital watches and digital dictionaries are allowed.
    
    \item Submission can be done by filling in Google Forms. The links of the Google Forms are on the 1st pages of each question paper.
    
    \item Students may only submit once. If there are multiple submissions, only the first one will be considered.
    
    \item Please submit the answers by Friday 5 July 2024, 23:59 WIB. Late submissions will still be marked, but not included in the ranking.
