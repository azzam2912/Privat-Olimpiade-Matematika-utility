\section*{Fast Precise Questions}
\begin{enumerate}
\item What number should we replace $\square$ with, so that
    \[ 41 + 39 = 95 - \square ? \]

\item By how much is the sum of $31+1000$ greater than the difference of
    $31 - 1000$?

\item What digit should we replace $\square$ with, so that
    \[ 7 \text{ tens} + 8 \text{ tens} + 50 \text{ ones} = \square \text{ hundreds}? \]

\item Find the missing number.
    \[ 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, \dots \]

\item How many two-digit numbers are smaller than 90?

\item Which whole even numbers are smaller than 2025 and greater than 2022?

\item Initially, George had 20 books. Nine of them were red, and the rest were yellow. He gave 7 yellow books to his mother. Then he gave 3 yellow books to his friend Maria. How many yellow books does he have left?

\item Harry planted 24 trees in a row. Each 2 trees were planted 1 meter apart. What is the length (in meters) of the row of trees that Harry planted?

\item A triangle has side lengths of 7 cm, 7 cm and 6 cm. A square has a side length of 1 dm. By how many centimetres is the perimeter of the square greater than the perimeter of the triangle?

\item I have two sticks – one with a length of 15 cm and one with a length of 5 cm. I used them to measure the length of a board. I used the stick with a length of 15 cm three times, and I used the stick with a length of 5 cm once. Find the length of the board in cm.

\item Calculate
    \[ (207 + 209 + 211 + 213 + 215 + 217) - (217 + 215 + 213 + 209 + 207) \]

\item If
\begin{align*}
    a+b &= 2\\
    b+c &= 3\\
    c+d &= 4\\
    d+a &= 3
\end{align*}
calculate $a+b+c+d$.

\item Calculate $(2015 - 2005 - 2004 - 2003 - 2002 - 2001) + (2001 + 2002 + 2003 + 2004 + 2005)$.
