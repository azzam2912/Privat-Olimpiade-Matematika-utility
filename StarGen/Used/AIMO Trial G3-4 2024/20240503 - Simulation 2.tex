\begin{enumerate}[resume]
    \item Among the 36 natural numbers from 1 to 36, at least how many numbers have to be picked so that there must be 2 numbers whose difference is 18?
    
    \vspace{10cm} \item Define the operation symbol $\oplus$ following this pattern:
    \begin{align*}
    1 \oplus 5 &= 1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + 5\\
    3 \oplus 8 &= 3 - 4 + 5 - 6 + 7 - 8\\
    5 \oplus 9 &= 5 - 6 + 7 - 8 + 9\\
    \dots& \text{(and so on ...)}
    \end{align*}
    Find the value of $(5 \oplus 10) - (4 \oplus 9).$
    
    \vspace{10cm} \item Ronny runs after Sunny at a speed of 25 km/h. In the beginning, Sunny is 3 km ahead of Ronny. If Ronny manages to meet Sunny 12 minutes later, how many kilometres does Sunny run each hour?
    
    \vspace{13cm} \item Define $F(a)$ as $3 \times a+1$. Find the value of $n$ if $F(F(n))=40$.
    
    \vspace{10cm} \item 5 bags of rice, 6 bags of soybeans and 9 bags of red beans weigh 60 kilograms, while 17 bags of rice, 18 bags of soybean and 27 bags of red beans weigh 200 kilograms. So how many kilograms does 1 bag of rice weigh?
    
    \vspace{10cm} \item There are two positive integers. Their sum is 143 and their product is 1080. Find the greater number among these two numbers.
    
    \vspace{10cm} \item The four members in Mandy's family have their ages add up to 99. Her brother is 8 years younger than Mandy. Dad is 3 years older than Mum. 10 years ago, the family ages added up to 65. How old is Mum this year?
