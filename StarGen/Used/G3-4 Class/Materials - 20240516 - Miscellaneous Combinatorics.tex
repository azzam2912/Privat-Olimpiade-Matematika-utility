    \item Given figure of the paths of the running race where each letter represent checkpoint. Each participants starting from the left (letter "N") running to the right until the finish (letter "A") on the rightmost of the figure. If they completed the race, the checkpoints they have passed will formed word "NAYLA". In how many ways are there to form the word "NAYLA"?
